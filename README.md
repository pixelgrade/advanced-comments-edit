# Advanced Comments Edit

This is a WordPress plugin that allows you to gain easy access to advanced comment data: assigned post ID, parent comment ID, comment owner user ID, author IP, author agent and the comment date.

WordPress doesn't allow easy access to edit a range of comment details. There are certain cases where a site administrator would like to assign comments to a certain user, change the comment parent post, etc. You can now do all these with this plugin.

You can edit the following comment advanced details:

* Post ID
* Parent Comment ID
* User ID
* Author IP
* Author Agent
* Comment Date
